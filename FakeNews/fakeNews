“CATEGORY 1: Below is a list of fake, false, or regularly misleading websites 
that are shared on Facebook and social media. Some of these websites may rely on “outrage” 
by using distorted headlines and decontextualized or dubious information in order to generate likes, shares, and profits. 
These websites are categorized with the number 1 next to them.

“CATEGORY 2: Some websites on this list may circulate misleading and/or potentially unreliable information.

“CATEGORY 3: Other websites on this list sometimes use clickbait-y headlines and social media descriptions.

“CATEGORY 4: Other sources on this list are purposefully fake with the intent of satire/comedy, 
which can offer important critical commentary on politics and society, but have the potential 
to be shared as actual/literal news. I’m including them here, for now, because 
1.) they have the potential to perpetuate misinformation based on different audience (mis)interpretations and 
2.) to make sure anyone who reads a story by The Onion, for example, understands its purpose. 
If you think this is unnecessary, please see Literally Unbelievable.”

In addition to the list, Zimdars has created a tip sheet for news consumers so that we all might better decipher what's real, 
what's fake, and what's simply misleading in ways that have nothing to do with whether you agree with a particular article 
or not:

    Avoid websites that end in “lo” ex: Newslo (above). 
These sites take pieces of accurate information and then packaging that information with 
other false or misleading “facts” (sometimes for the purposes of satire or comedy).

    Watch out for websites that end in “.com.co” as they are often fake versions of real news sources  

    Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. 
Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, 
but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.

    Odd domain names generally equal odd and rarely truthful news.

    Lack of author attribution may, but not always, signify that the news story is suspect and requires verification.

    Some news organizations are also letting bloggers post under the banner of particular news brands; 
however, many of these posts do not go through the same editing process 
(ex: BuzzFeed Community Posts, Kinja blogs, Forbes blogs).

    Check the “About Us” tab on websites or look up the website on Snopes or 
Wikipedia for more information about the source.

    Bad web design and use of ALL CAPS can also be a sign that the source you’re looking at should be verified 
and/or read in conjunction with other sources.

    If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it’s probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources 
to make sure the story you read wasn’t purposefully trying to make you angry 
(with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.
    It’s always best to read multiple sources of information to get a variety of viewpoints and media frames. 
Some sources not yet included in this list (although their practices at times may qualify them for addition), 
such as The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, and Fox News, vacillate between providing 
important, legitimate, problematic, and/or hyperbolic news coverage, requiring readers and viewers to verify 
and contextualize information with other sources.
